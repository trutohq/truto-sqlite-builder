## üìù Writing Code

### Code Style

- We use **Prettier** for code formatting
- We use **ESLint** with security plugins for linting
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use readonly types for immutable data

### Security Considerations

This is a security-focused library. When contributing:

- **Never introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities**
- **Validate all user inputs**
- **Use parameterized queries exclusively**
- **Test security features thoroughly**
- **Consider edge cases and attack vectors**

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage

- We maintain **100% test coverage**
- All new code must include comprehensive tests
- Tests should cover both happy paths and error cases

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('feature name', () => {
  describe('specific functionality', () => {
    it('should do something specific', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test input';

      // Act
      const result = sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ${input}`;

      // Assert
      expect(result.text).toBe('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?');
      expect(result.values).toEqual(['test input']);
    });
  });
});
```

### Security Tests

Always include tests for:

- SQL injection attempts
- Edge cases with special characters
- Invalid inputs
- Boundary conditions

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Run the full test suite:**

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Add a changeset** for your changes:
   ```bash
